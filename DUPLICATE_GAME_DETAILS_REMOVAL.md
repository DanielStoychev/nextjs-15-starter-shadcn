# Game Details Section - Duplicate Removal Complete

## ✅ What was removed:

The redundant plain text "Game Details" section has been successfully removed from the main game page (`src/app/games/[gameSlug]/[instanceId]/page.tsx`).

### ❌ REMOVED - Old Plain Text Section:

```
Game Details
Pick one Premier League team per gameweek to WIN their match...
Game Type: Last Man Standing
Status: PENDING
Starts: 6/21/2025
Ends: 7/21/2025
Entry Fee: £10.00
Prize Pool: £8.00
```

## ✅ What remains:

The new, beautifully styled Game Details section within the Last Man Standing component that features:

- Consistent background colors matching all other cards/tables
- Professional 4-column responsive grid layout
- Proper semantic styling with muted colors
- Dynamic data display
- Modern card-based UI

## 🔧 Technical Changes:

1. **Removed entire Card section** from `page.tsx` (lines 725-763)
2. **Fixed TypeScript compatibility** by properly mapping `game.description` from `string | null` to `string | undefined`
3. **Maintained component functionality** - no breaking changes

## 🎯 Result:

- ✅ No duplicate Game Details sections
- ✅ Consistent visual styling across the application
- ✅ Clean, professional UI
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ All functionality preserved

The application now has a single, well-designed Game Details section that integrates seamlessly with the Last Man Standing game interface, using consistent styling that matches the rest of the application.
